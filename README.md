# VampireSurviorClone

Scope:
Developed a clone of the popular Vampire Survivors game, focusing on core gameplay loop design, enemy spawning systems, and character progression mechanics.

Implemented scalable game systems including player upgrades, wave balancing, and performance optimization for large numbers of on-screen entities.

Experimented with data-driven balancing (enemy HP, spawn rates, upgrade effects) to refine player engagement.

Gained hands-on experience in rapid prototyping and iteration, simulating real-world product feature testing.
